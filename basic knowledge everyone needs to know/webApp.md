# Basic Knowledge EVERYONE needs to know!
# What is WebApp
A web application (or web app) is application software that is accessed using a web browser. Web applications **are delivered on the World Wide Web** to users with an active network connection
- what is application software?
Application software is a type of computer program that performs a specific personal, educational, and business function. Each application is designed to assist end-users in accomplishing a variety of tasks, which **may be related** to productivity, creativity, or communication.


- What is the difference between "on-premise" and "hosted" application software?
On-premise application software is **implemented at an organization’s physical location**, leveraging the hardware, IT infrastructure, and support of that organization. The company’s IT department typically maintains and solves problems related to the software.
Hosted application software, also called Software As A Service (SaaS), is software that is owned, delivered, and managed remotely via the cloud by a provider separate from the purchasing organization. Many organizations license these programs at the same time, and organizations typically pay per user or via a subscription.

One advantage of on-premise software is that it can be customized to the individual company’s needs more easily. However, hosted application software programs generally allow users to scale up more quickly.

# History

In earlier computing models like client-server, the processing load for the application was shared between code on the server and code installed on each client locally. In other words, an application had its own pre-compiled client program which served as its user interface and had to be separately installed on each user's personal computer.

Can somebody help me?
```


An upgrade to the server-side code of the application would typically also require an upgrade to the client-side code installed on each user workstation, adding to the support cost and decreasing productivity. In addition, both the client and server components of the application were usually tightly bound to a particular computer architecture and operating system and porting them to others was often **prohibitively expensive(太昂贵了)** for all but the largest applications (Nowadays, native apps for mobile devices are also hobbled by some or all of the foregoing issues).

In 1995, Netscape introduced a client-side scripting language called JavaScript allowing programmers to add some dynamic elements to the user interface that ran on the client side. So instead of sending data to the server in order to generate an entire web page, the embedded scripts of the downloaded page can perform various tasks such as input validation or showing/hiding parts of the page.

Use timemachine...
```

In 1999, the "web application" concept was introduced in the Java language in the Servlet Specification version 2.2. At that time both JavaScript and XML had already been developed, but Ajax had still not yet been coined and the XMLHttpRequest object had only been recently introduced on Internet Explorer 5 as an ActiveX object.

In 2005, the term Ajax was **coined**, and applications like Gmail started to make their client sides more and more interactive. A web page script is able to contact the server for storing/retrieving data without downloading an entire web page.
